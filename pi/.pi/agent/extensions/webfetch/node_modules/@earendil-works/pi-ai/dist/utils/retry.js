/**
 * Run a single assistant-producing call with bounded retry on transient errors.
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - A successful response is returned immediately. Aborts are terminal and never
 *   retried, but reported as unsuccessful if they happen after a retry was scheduled.
 *   Aborts during the backoff sleep are normalized to an aborted `AssistantMessage`
 *   too, so callers do not need to care when cancellation happened.
 * - A non-retryable error (per {@link isRetryableAssistantError}, including quota/
 *   billing exhaustion) is returned immediately so deterministic errors fail fast.
 * - Otherwise retries up to `maxRetries` times with exponential backoff, emitting
 *   `onRetryScheduled` before each sleep, `onRetryAttemptStart` after each sleep before
 *   the retried call starts, and `onRetryFinished` once at the end (whether the loop
 *   ends in success, exhausted retries, or an aborted backoff).
 *
 * When `policy` is undefined or disabled, the first response is returned unchanged
 * (equivalent to calling `produce()` directly).
