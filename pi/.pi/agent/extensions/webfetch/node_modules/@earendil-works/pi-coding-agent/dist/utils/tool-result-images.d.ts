 * that produce images themselves (extensions, MCP bridges, screenshot tools) hand back arbitrary
 * base64 payloads that go straight into session history and every subsequent provider request.
 * Oversized images make the provider reject the whole conversation, not just the offending turn,
 * so normalize them once as they enter history.
 *
 * Returns the original array when nothing changed so callers can skip rewriting the result.
